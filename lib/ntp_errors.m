%NTP_ERRORS  The epsilon neutrality error and slope error from the neutral tangent plane
%
%
% [ex,ey] = ntp_errors(s,t,x,dx,dy,use_s_t,centre,wrap)
% computes the zonal and meridional neutrality errors, ex and ey, for an
% approximately neutral surface on which the practical / Absolute salinity
% is s, the potential / Conservative temperature is t, and the pressure or
% depth is x.
% The zonal and meridional distances between neighbouring grid points are
% dx and dy.
% If use_s_t is true, errors are calculated using s and t differences
% multiplied by the partial derivatives of in-situ density w.r.t s and t,
% respectively; if use_s_t is false, errors are calculated using in-situ
% density differences and x differences multiplied by the partial
% derivative of in-situ density w.r.t. x.
% If centre is true, errors are calculated using centred differences, and
% results are on the grid points of s, t and x; otherwise, backward
% differences are used and results for ex and ey are located zonally and
% meridionally, respectively, midway between s, t, and x grid points.
% Data is treated periodic in the i'th (i=1 or 2) dimension of x if and
% only if wrap(i) is true.
%
% [ex,ey,sx,sy] = ntp_errors(s,t,x,dx,dy,use_s_t,centre,wrap,grav,S,T,X)
% also computes the zonal and meridional slope errors, sx and sy, for an
% ocean of practical / Absolute salinity S and potential / Conservative
% temperature T at datasites where the pressure or depth is X.
%
% The equation of state for the in-situ density is given by eos.m in the
% path.  If use_s_t is true, eos_s_t.m must also exist in the path and
% return the partial derivatives of in-situ density w.r.t s and t;
% otherwise, eos_x.m must also exist in the path and return the partial
% derivative of in-situ density w.r.t x. The inputs to these eos*.m
% functions must be (s, t, x).  Note, eos*.m can involve specific volume
% instead of in-situ density, which merely changes the units of [ex,ey].
%
% For a non-Boussinesq ocean, X and x are pressure [dbar].  When sx, sy are
% requested, the gravitational acceleration grav must be given.
%
% For a Boussinesq ocean, X and x are depth [m, positive].  When sx, sy are
% requested, grav must be the empty vector [].
%
%
% --- Input:
% s     [ni, nj]: practical / Absolute salinity on the surface
% t     [ni, nj]: potential / Conservative temperature on the surface
% x     [ni, nj]: pressure [dbar] or depth [m, positive] of the surface
% dx    [ni, nj]: Zonal      grid distance [m] between S(:,i,j) and S(:,i-1,j)
% dy    [ni, nj]: Meridional grid distance [m] between S(:,i,j) and S(:,i,j-1)
% use_s_t [1, 1]: true to compute ex,ey using s and t differences,
%                 false to use eos(s,t,x) and x differences.
% centre  [1, 1]: true to compute outputs on the central grid, 
%                 false on the half grids
% wrap    [2, 1]: wrap(i) is true when the data is periodic in i'th
%                 dimension of x
% grav    [1, 1]: gravitational acceleration [m s^-2]
% S [nk, ni, nj]: practical / Absolute salinity
% T [nk, ni, nj]: potential / Conservative temperature
% X [nk, ni, nj] or [nk, 1]: pressure [dbar] or depth [m, positive]
%
% Note: nk is the maximum number of data points per water column,
%       ni is the number of data points in longitude,
%       nj is the number of data points in latitude.
%
% Note: data can be arranged as latitude by longitude.  Simply swap dx and
%       dy, adjust wrap as needed, and note the outputs ex and ey will also
%       be swapped, as will be sx and sy.
%
% Note: physical units for s,t,x,S,T,X are determined by eos*.m.
%
% Note: X must be increasing along its first dimension.
%
% Note: dx and dy can have any dimension replaced by a singleton dimension.
%
%
% --- Output:
% ex [ni, nj]: zonal epsilon neutrality error [(kg m^-3) / m or (m^3 / kg) / m]
% ey [ni, nj]: meridional epsilon neutrality error [(kg m^-3) / m or (m^3 / kg) / m]
% sx [ni, nj]: zonal slope error [dimensionless]
% sy [ni, nj]: meridional slope error [dimensionless]
%
%
% --- Mathematical form of ex, ey, sx, sy:
% The neutrality error (usually denoted by epsilon) is here taken as one of
% two mathematically equivalent forms:
%   [ex,ey] = rs grad s + rt grad t
% when use_s_t is true, or
%   [ex,ey] = grad r - rx grad x
% when use_s_t is false.  
% Here, the pressure or depth of the surface is x; s and t are the values
% of S and T on the surface projected onto a sphere; r = eos(s,t,x) is the
% in-situ density on the surface; rs, rt, and rx are the partial
% derivatives of in-situ density with respect to S, T, and X respectively,
% evaluated on the surface. Note that grad s is the same as grad_a S
% evaluated on the surface, where grad_a is the projected non-orthogonal
% gradient. See discussion of the under-tilde operator in Stanley (2019).
%
% The above definition is equivalent to Stanley (2019) Eq. (28), but
% differs from the standard definition by a factor of r, the in-situ
% density. The standard definition (McDougall and Jackett 1988, p. 162) is
% [ex,ey] / r.
%
% The slope error is related to the neutrality error by
%   [sx,sy] = g / (r N2) [ex,ey] = -1 / (d sigma / d z) [ex,ey]
% where g is the gravitational acceleration and N2 is the square of the
% vertical stratification, and sigma is the locally referenced potential
% density. This differs from the standard relation (see McDougall and
% Jackett 1988 Eq. (14), or Klocker and McDougall 2009, Eq. (10)) by a
% factor of r because of our definition for [ex,ey] above.
