function [ex,ey] = ntp_epsilon_s_t(s, t, x, dx, dy, centre, wrap)
%NTP_EPSILON_S_T  The epsilon neutrality error using salinity and temperature
%
%
% [ex,ey] = ntp_epsilon_s_t(s,t,x,dx,dy,centre,wrap)
% computes the zonal and meridional neutrality errors, ex and ey, for an
% approximately neutral surface on which the practical / Absolute salinity
% is s, the potential / Conservative temperature is t, and the pressure or
% depth is x. The zonal and meridional distances between neighbouring grid
% points are dx and dy. Results are calculated on the grid points of s, t
% and x if centre is true; otherwise, zonal and meridional errors are
% located zonally and meridionally, respectively, midway between s, t, and
% x grid points. Data is treated periodic in the i'th (i=1 or 2) dimension
% of x if and only if wrap(i) is true.  The equation of state is given by
% eos.m in the path which must accept s, t, and x as inputs.
%
% For a non-Boussinesq ocean, x is pressure [dbar].
%
% For a Boussinesq ocean, x is depth [m, positive].
%
%
% --- Input:
% s     [ni, nj]: practical / Absolute salinity on the surface
% t     [ni, nj]: potential / Conservative temperature on the surface
% x     [ni, nj]: pressure [dbar] or depth [m, positive] of the surface
% dx    [ni, nj]: Zonal      grid distance [m] between S(:,i,j) and S(:,i-1,j)
% dy    [ni, nj]: Meridional grid distance [m] between S(:,i,j) and S(:,i,j-1)
% centre  [1, 1]: true to compute outputs on the central grid, false on the
%                 half grids [logical]
% wrap    [2, 1]: wrap(i) is true when the data is periodic in i'th
%                 dimension of x
% grav    [1, 1]: gravitational acceleration [m s^-2]
%
% Note: nk is the maximum number of data points per water column,
%       ni is the number of data points in longitude,
%       nj is the number of data points in latitude.
%
% Note: data can be arranged as latitude by longitude.  Simply swap dx and
%       dy, adjust wrap as needed, and note the outputs ex and ey will also
%       be swapped, as will be sx and sy.
%
% Note: physical units for s,t,x,S,T,X are determined by eos.m and eos_s_t.m.
%
% Note: X must be increasing along its first dimension.
%
% Note: dx and dy can have any dimension replaced by a singleton dimension.
%
%
% --- Output:
% ex [ni, nj]: zonal epsilon neutrality error [kg m^-4]
% ey [ni, nj]: meridional epsilon neutrality error [kg m^-4]
%
%
% --- Mathematical form of ex, ey, sx, sy:
% The neutrality error (usually denoted by epsilon) is here taken as
%   [ex,ey] = rs grad s + rt grad t
% where s and t are the values of S and T on the surface projected onto a
% sphere, and rs and rt are the partial derivatives of in-situ density with
% respect to S and T, respectively, taken on the surface. Note that grad s
% is the same as grad_a S evaluated on the surface, where grad_a is the
% projected non-orthogonal gradient. See discussion of the under-tilde
% operator in Stanley (2019).
%
% The above definition is equivalent to Stanley (2019) Eq. (28), but
% differs from the standard definition by a factor of r. The standard
% definition (McDougall and Jackett 1988, p. 162) is [ex,ey] / r.
%
% The slope error is related to the neutrality error by
%   [sx,sy] = g / (r N2) [ex,ey] = -1 / (d sigma / d z) [ex,ey]
% where g is the gravitational acceleration and N2 is the square of the
% vertical stratification, and sigma is the locally referenced potential
% density. This differs from the standard relation (see McDougall and
% Jackett 1988 Eq. (14), or Klocker and McDougall 2009, Eq. (10)) by a
% factor of r because of our definition for [ex,ey] above.
